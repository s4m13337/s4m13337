# Mahalo 👋

I am an application developer and I do recreational programming. I specialize in machine learning and signal processing.

The first programming I learned was C. Although professionally I work with several other languages and frameworks, I continue to use C for all my hobby projects.

My physics professor introduced me to Emacs in 2014. After 10 years, I am still trying to get rid of it, but I just can't; Emacs is awesome.
